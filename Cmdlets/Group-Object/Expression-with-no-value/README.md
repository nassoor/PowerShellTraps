# `Group-Object` and properties made by expressions with no values

`Group-Object` may fail with `NullReferenceException` if input objects have a
`NoteProperty` made by an expression with no value. It works fine in v2, so the
issue was introduced by a later version.

A workaround, if applicable, is to change an expression so that it returns
`$null` instead of nothing.
