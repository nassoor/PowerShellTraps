# `Set-Content` fails in a directory with brackets

If `Set-Content -Path` is invoked in a directory with brackets then it fails.

If `Set-Content -LiteralPath` is invoked in a directory with brackets then it
works fine in v3+ and silently fails in PowerShell v2.

The script [Test-1-directory-with-brackets.ps1](Test-1-directory-with-brackets.ps1) shows the issue.
