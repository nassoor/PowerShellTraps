# `ForEach-Object`

When `ForEach-Object` is used in a pipeline with other commands and its
scriptblock causes an error then the error info tends to be not clear.

`ForEach-Object` can be replaced with `.{process{...}}`. The latter works
faster and does not obfuscate information of potential errors.

Scripts

- [Oops.ps1](Oops.ps1) simulates a problematic script, it just throws an error.
- [test1.ForEach-Object.bad.error.info.ps1](test1.ForEach-Object.bad.error.info.ps1) uses `ForEach-Object` and shows bad error information.
- [test2.ScriptBlock.good.error.info.ps1](test2.ScriptBlock.good.error.info.ps1) uses `.{process{...}}` and shows clear error information.
- [test3.measure.performance.ps1](test3.measure.performance.ps1) shows that `.{process{...}}` is much faster than `ForEach-Object`.
