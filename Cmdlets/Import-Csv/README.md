# `Import-Csv` may trim leading spaces

`Import-Csv` may trim leading spaces. Thus, it may change data. Compare: open
[Import-Csv.trims.leading.spaces.csv](Import-Csv.trims.leading.spaces.csv) in *Excel*, all the spaces are preserved.
Interestingly, `Import-Csv` in the same example keeps trailing spaces.

Note that this is not be a problem if `Import-Csv` reads data exported by
`Export-Csv`. `Export-Csv` uses double quotes for values. In this case
`Import-Csv` preserves data as they are.

The script [Import-Csv.trims.leading.spaces.ps1](Import-Csv.trims.leading.spaces.ps1) imports a CSV file and shows
some result data with leading spaced trimmed.
