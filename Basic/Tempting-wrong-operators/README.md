# Tempting wrong operators

It may be tempting to use some wrong operators, e.g. used in other languages,
instead of PowerShell operators. Such mistakes are not always easy to discover.
Wrong operators are not always syntax errors, they may do something unexpected.

Scripts

- [test.1.eq.ps1](test.1.eq.ps1) - the assignment operator `=` is used instead of `-eq`.
- [test.2.gt.ps1](test.2.gt.ps1) - the redirection operator `>` is used instead of `-gt`.
