# `ThrowTerminatingError` does not trigger the immediate catch

`$PSCmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError()` may have some advantages over `throw`. But
it has an issue: if it is called from a `try` block directly, i.e. not from
another command in it, then the `catch` is not called, at least in v5. The
`finally` block is still called. Note that the `catch` is called in v2.

`Write-Error -ErrorAction Stop` may be used as a workaround.
