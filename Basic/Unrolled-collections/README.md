# Unrolled collections

PowerShell may unroll collections, that is replace an original collection with
an array of its items or just a single item.

This fact is especially easy to forget for some complex objects like
`[System.Data.DataTable]`. PowerShell may treat it as a collection of
`[System.Data.DataRow]` and the original table instance may be "lost".

The common workaround is use of the comma operator which wraps an argument with
an array of a single item. This array is unrolled and this gets its single item
as it is, not unrolled.

Scripts

- [Test-1-unrolled-adding.ps1](Test-1-unrolled-adding.ps1) shows unrolling on adding items to an array using `+=`.
- [Test-2-unrolled-output.ps1](Test-2-unrolled-output.ps1) shows a collection unrolled on output from a function.
- [Test-3-unrolled-return.ps1](Test-3-unrolled-return.ps1) is the similar script which uses `return` explicitly.
- [Test-4-unrolled-if.ps1](Test-4-unrolled-if.ps1) shows how `if ($x) {$y}` unrolls data, see also [Missing-ternary-operator](../Missing-ternary-operator).
