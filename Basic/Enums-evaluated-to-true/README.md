# Enums evaluated to true

In PowerShell v2, v3, v4 `[System.Enum]` values are always evaluated to true in
logical expressions, even though their numerical value is 0, and 0 is evaluated
to false in PowerShell. PowerShell v5 works differently in a more expected way.

The script [object-looks-like-0-and-true.ps1](object-looks-like-0-and-true.ps1)
shows an object equal to 0 and yet evaluated to true.
