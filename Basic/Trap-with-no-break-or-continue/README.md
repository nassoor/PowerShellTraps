# `trap` with no `break` or `continue`

What does `trap` without `break` or `continue` do?

Help *about_trap*:

> If you include a Continue statement in a Trap statement, Windows PowerShell
resumes after the statement that caused the error, just as it would without
Break or Continue. With the Continue keyword, however, Windows PowerShell
does not write an error to the error stream.

This is correct but may sound misleading, as if `trap` without `break` or
`continue` resumes, just as it would with `continue`. It resumes as with
`continue` and it also writes a terminating error as non-terminating. The
result depends on the current error action preference.

Scripts

- [error.action.continue.ps1](error.action.continue.ps1) - bare `trap` resumes on error action *Continue*.
- [error.action.stop.ps1](error.action.stop.ps1) - bare `trap` stops on error action *Stop*.
