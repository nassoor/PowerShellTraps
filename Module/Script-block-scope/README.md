# Script block scope

If a script block is passed in a *script* function and invoked there by the dot
operator then it operates in the current scope.

If a script block is passed in a *module* function and invoked there by the dot
operator then it does not operate in the current scope. Where it operates
depends on other factors.

Scripts

- [Script1.ps1](Script1.ps1) defines the function *Invoke-ScriptBlockParameter* which is used in the module and script.
- [Module1.psm1](Module1.psm1) dot-sources [Script1.ps1](Script1.ps1) and exports *Invoke-ScriptBlockParameter* for testing.
- [Test-Module1.ps1](Test-Module1.ps1) imports [Module1.psm1](Module1.psm1) and calls *Invoke-ScriptBlockParameter*, the results are strange.
- [Test-Script1.ps1](Test-Script1.ps1) dot-sources [Script1.ps1](Script1.ps1) and calls *Invoke-ScriptBlockParameter*, the result is expected.
- [.test.ps1](.test.ps1) tests [Test-Script1.ps1](Test-Script1.ps1) and two ways of invoking [Test-Module1.ps1](Test-Module1.ps1) with two different results.

#### Workaround

A workaround was suggested by Tom Maddock at Microsoft Connect. A script block
`$ScriptBlock` passed in a module function may be invoked as

    . $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Module $ScriptBlock

In this case `$ScriptBlock` operates in the current scope.

Scripts

- [Workaround/Module2.psm1](Workaround/Module2.psm1) exports a function which invokes a script block using the workaround.
- [Workaround/Test-Module2.ps1](Workaround/Test-Module2.ps1) imports the module and passes a script block in the function.
- [Workaround/.test.ps1](Workaround/.test.ps1) tests the workaround.
