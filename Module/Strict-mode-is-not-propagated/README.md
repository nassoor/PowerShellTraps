# Strict mode is not propagated

When the strict mode is set then it is propagated to the current and child
scopes in scripts but not in modules.

Scripts

- [Script1.ps1](Script1.ps1) reads a missing variable.
- [Script2.ps1](Script2.ps1) defines a function that reads a missing variable.
- [Module1.psm1](Module1.psm1) defines a function that reads a missing variable.
- [Test-1-Script1.ps1](Test-1-Script1.ps1) sets the strict mode and invokes *Script1*, it fails.
- [Test-2-Script2.ps1](Test-2-Script2.ps1) sets the strict mode, dot-sources *Script2*, and invokes the function, it fails.
- [Test-3-Module1.ps1](Test-3-Module1.ps1) sets the strict mode, imports *Module1*, and invokes the function, it does not fail.
