# Not found function (part 2)

[1]: http://stackoverflow.com/q/25033346/323582

If a module imports functions from several modules and a function from one
module calls a function from another then the latter may be not found. The
script [Test-Fails.ps1](Test-Fails.ps1) shows the problem.

This problem is specific for a module function which imports other modules. If
a script function repeats the same scenario with other modules then it works,
see [Test-Works.ps1](Test-Works.ps1).
